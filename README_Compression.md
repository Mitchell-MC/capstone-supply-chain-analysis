# FAF5.7 Dataset Compression Tool

This tool creates a comprehensive snapshot of the full FAF5.7 dataset that is under 100MB while preserving key patterns, distributions, and diversity.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Reduce the FAF5.7 dataset size for easier sharing and faster processing
- Maintain statistical integrity and representativeness
- Preserve geographic, commodity, and modal diversity
- Include high-value corridors and extreme values
- Create a sample suitable for exploration, prototyping, and development

## 📁 Files

- `create_faf5_compressed_dataset.py` - Main compression script
- `run_compression.py` - Simple runner script
- `README_Compression.md` - This documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct execution
```bash
python create_faf5_compressed_dataset.py
```

### Option 2: Using the runner
```bash
python run_compression.py
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- The original `FAF5.7_State.csv` file in the same directory

## 📊 Sampling Strategy

The tool uses a multi-strategy approach to ensure comprehensive representation:

### 1. **Stratified Sampling**
- **Geographic**: Samples from all origin states
- **Commodity**: Represents all SCTG2 commodity types  
- **Modal**: Includes all transportation modes
- **Distance**: Covers all distance bands

### 2. **High-Value Preservation**
- Top freight corridors by value
- Highest tonnage routes  
- Major ton-mile corridors

### 3. **Statistical Extremes**
- High and low values for key metrics
- Outliers and edge cases
- Ensures full range representation

### 4. **Temporal Diversity**
- High-growth corridors (2017-2023)
- Declining routes
- Different temporal patterns

### 5. **Random Sampling**
- General population representation
- Unbiased baseline sample

## 📈 Quality Assurance

The tool validates sample quality by checking:
- **Category Coverage**: % of unique values preserved
- **Distribution Preservation**: Key percentiles maintained
- **Geographic Representation**: All states included
- **Commodity Diversity**: All major freight types

## 🎯 Output Files

### `FAF5.7_State_Compressed.csv`
- The compressed dataset (<100MB)
- Ready for analysis and exploration
- Maintains column structure of original

### `FAF5.7_Compression_Metadata.txt`
- Detailed compression statistics
- Quality validation metrics
- Sampling methodology documentation
- Usage recommendations

## 📊 Typical Results

- **Original**: ~1.2M records, ~500MB
- **Compressed**: ~50-80K records, <100MB  
- **Compression Ratio**: ~90-95% size reduction
- **Quality**: >90% category coverage, >85% distribution preservation

## 💡 Usage Recommendations

### ✅ Good for:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Prototype development
- Algorithm testing
- Sharing for collaboration
- Training and education

### ⚠️ Consider full dataset for:
- Production models
- Final statistical analysis
- Comprehensive reporting
- Publication-quality research

## 🔧 Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Adjust target file size (change `target_size_mb` parameter)
- Modify sampling strategies
- Add custom selection criteria
- Change validation metrics

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **File not found**
   - Ensure `FAF5.7_State.csv` is in the current directory
   - Check file permissions

2. **Memory errors**
   - The script is optimized for large datasets
   - If issues persist, try reducing sampling sizes

3. **Size target not met**
   - Script automatically adjusts sample size
   - Very dense data might require manual adjustment

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the metadata file for compression details
2. Verify input file format and location
3. Review error messages in console output
