# üö® RISK ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE RISK FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Risk Scoring System (1-10 scale)** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Transport Mode Risk Scores:**
- **Water Transport**: 8/10 (Highest Risk)
  - Extremely long lead times, port congestion, geopolitical chokepoints
- **Air Transport**: 7/10 (High Risk)
  - Extremely high costs, capacity constraints, weather delays
- **Multiple Modes & Mail**: 7/10 (High Risk)
  - Complexity at transfer points, coordination challenges
- **Truck Transport**: 6/10 (Medium-High Risk)
  - Road congestion, driver shortages, fuel price volatility
- **Rail Transport**: 5/10 (Medium Risk)
  - Infrastructure failures, limited network flexibility
- **Pipeline**: 4/10 (Low-Medium Risk)
  - Catastrophic failure potential, but operationally reliable
- **No Domestic Mode**: 3/10 (Low Risk)
  - Concentrated dependency on single entry point
- **Other/Unknown**: 10/10 (Critical Risk)
  - Complete lack of visibility and accountability

### **2. Key Risk Factor Identification per Transport Mode** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Detailed Risk Factors by Mode:**

#### **Water Transport (8/10)**
- Port congestion and delays
- Customs clearance issues
- Geopolitical chokepoints
- Cargo damage/loss at sea
- Weather and natural disasters
- Piracy and security threats

#### **Air Transport (7/10)**
- Extremely high operational costs
- Capacity constraints and limited availability
- Shipment handling damage
- Weather delays at airports
- Security screening delays
- Fuel price sensitivity

#### **Truck Transport (6/10)**
- Road congestion and traffic delays
- Driver shortages and labor issues
- Fuel price volatility
- Cargo theft and security
- Weather-related disruptions
- Last-mile delivery challenges

#### **Rail Transport (5/10)**
- Derailments and infrastructure failures
- Limited network flexibility
- Intermodal hub delays
- Track maintenance issues
- Weather-related service disruptions

### **3. Risk-Weighted Analysis of Supply Chain Resilience** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Risk-Adjusted Calculations:**
```python
# Risk-weighted value calculation
risk_weighted_value = value * (1 - risk_score / 10)

# Risk-adjusted resilience score
risk_adjusted_resilience = resilience_score * (1 - transport_risk_score / 10)
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Original vs Risk-Adjusted Resilience**: Shows impact of transport risk on overall resilience
- **Value at Risk**: Quantifies economic exposure by transport mode
- **Risk Impact Percentage**: Measures reduction in resilience due to transport risk
- **Regional Risk Analysis**: Compares risk-adjusted resilience across origin regions

---

### **4. Risk-Based Recommendations for Mode Selection** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Priority-Based Recommendations:**

#### **üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY (Risk Score ‚â• 8)**
- **Water Transport**: Diversify port options, implement advanced cargo tracking
- **Other/Unknown**: Immediate mode identification required, implement tracking systems

#### **üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Risk Score 6-7)**
- **Air Transport**: Optimize cargo consolidation, develop multi-airport strategies
- **Multiple Modes**: Implement end-to-end tracking, establish single-point contact
- **Truck Transport**: Implement real-time tracking, develop driver retention programs

#### **üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Risk Score 4-5)**
- **Rail Transport**: Invest in infrastructure maintenance, develop multimodal partnerships
- **Pipeline**: Implement advanced monitoring systems, develop security protocols

#### **üü¢ OPPORTUNITY (Lowest Risk Mode)**
- **Pipeline (4/10)**: Consider increasing usage for high-value, time-sensitive shipments

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE**

All missing risk analysis components have been successfully implemented and integrated into the Supply_Chain_Volatility_Intl.ipynb notebook. The analysis now provides:

1. **Comprehensive risk assessment** for all transport modes
2. **Risk-weighted resilience analysis** that accounts for transport vulnerabilities
3. **Priority-based recommendations** with specific mitigation strategies
4. **Risk monitoring dashboard** for ongoing assessment

The notebook now addresses all original objectives plus the additional risk analysis requirements, providing a complete supply chain resilience assessment framework.
